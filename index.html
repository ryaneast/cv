  <p> I am Network Engineer in the Comcast CORE Reliability Engineering Group. I have 20 years of experience in Networking. I started my Networking Journey with a "Summer Job" as Tape I/O operator with Nordstrom in their Datacenter in Seattle. I had
    computer experience and a good work ethic so I was given trial position in the Nordstrom national NOC in Seattle after roughly 2 years I was asked if I would transfer to Denver to support the opening of the new Nordstrom Data Center where I
    received hands on hardware equipment, raised floor and facility management experience. I was tasked with staging and configuring routers and switches for the conversion from Tokenring to an Ethernet router on a stick multi vlan solution. To
    support Wireless inventory, POS, and back office respectively. This project caught the eye of Nordstrom Management and I was then offered a position back in Seattle in the Nordstrom Network Engineering group where I worked for several years doing
    project management, design and acting as an escalation point for the NOC. My main focus during this time was wireless 802.11 protocols in support of the wireless POS system. This included Beta Testing for Cisco, wireless site surveys, PPP
    wireless connections for MAN campus etc. I missed the weather in Denver so much my wife and I decided to move back and I was hired by Comcast as a contractor to hire I was hired on permanent as an engineer in the Comcast CRAN operations and
    finally to my current position as an Engineer 2 in the National CORE NOC. My responsibilities include the day to day operations of the Comcast Converged Regional Access Network and the Comcast National Backbone. The protocols and technologies I
    work with on a daily basis include Multicast, MPLS, ISIS, VRFs, Ethernet OSPF, PIM, STP and BGP. I have also have had past experience with EIGRP, RIP. The CLI's that I am fluent in include JUNOS, IOS, IOS XR, Opengear and Arista EOS. Layer 2:
    Ethernet, DOCSIS, Wireless 802.11. MPLS, VPN.
